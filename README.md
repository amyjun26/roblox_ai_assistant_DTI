## Notes
Our hackMIT team project! An AI stylist for the hit Roblox game Dress to Impress
* Tried SmartCrop, didn't improve the images
* Websocket payload to frontend looks like:
```json
{
	"clothing_items": ["hat"],
	"theme": "forest",
	"judge_opinion": "4/10",
	"num_players": 8,
	"num_stars": 8,
    "outfit": "[BASE64 encoded image]",
	"complete": true,
}
```
